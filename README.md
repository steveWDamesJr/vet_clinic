# Vet Clinic

> Vet Clinic Database. Query database to find information about specific animals. Built with PostgreSQL 

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate the Vet Clinic database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create Vet Clinic table.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate Vet Clinic table with data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) contains Vet Clinic queries that can be run on a newly created Vet Clinic database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
